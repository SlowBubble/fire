## How to deploy?

`firebase deploy`

## Doing

- TODO: think of how to add lyrics padding when a certain part has melody without lyrics (like the intro).
  - It may need to be done at the parts-joining level since even viola-1 is displaying incorrectly.
- Export tsv

## P1

- Re-design Upserter to detect triplet across 2 beats
  - beat3.Aggregator

## P2

* Think about comping
  * Add color notes if not the last beat.
  * Add color notes to short melodic notes if not the last note.
* Auto-minimize accidentals for chromatic lines.
* Changing time sig.
* Design compound time sig.
